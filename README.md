<h1 align="center">isepic-chess.js</h1>

`isepic-chess.js` is a chess utility library written in JavaScript, it provides features like legal moves calculation, FEN validation, SAN parsing, etc. (see: [Features](https://github.com/ajax333221/isepic-chess#rocket-features)).

<strong>Flexibility:</strong> it strives to be flexible (inspired in JavaScript) and attempts to make things work without easily giving up and throwing errors.

<strong>Code coverage:</strong> the extra flexibility adds extra complexity and paths to be tested, but despite this, the code coverage is <strong>98~%</strong> <sup>(as of `v6.0.0`)</sup>.

<strong>Perft-tested:</strong> each release is tested against known <em>Perft positions</em> to ensure that the move generation tree of legal moves do not vary from the correct count.

<strong>UI-less:</strong> all the bloating code that a user interface brings is completely separated into this other project: [Isepic Chess UI](https://github.com/ajax333221/isepic-chess-ui).

<strong>Dependency-less:</strong> does not depend on any other library.

:computer_mouse: Installation
-------------

```
# NPM
npm install isepic-chess
```
Then: `const {Ic} = require("isepic-chess");`

<hr>

```html
# Web browser
<script src="./isepic-chess.js"></script>
```
The variable `Ic` will be added to window.

:green_heart: Node.js example
-------------

```js
const {Ic} = require("isepic-chess");

var board, ascii_diagram, example_pgn;

example_pgn = `[Event "example game"]
[SetUp "1"]
[FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 2"]

2. Qf3 Nc6 3. Bc4`;

board = Ic.initBoard({
  boardName : "example_board",
  pgn : example_pgn
});

// same than passing a SAN move of "Nd4"
board.playMove("c6-d4");

// "Qxf7", "Qxf7++", "Q3xf7+", "Qfxf7", "Qf3xf7 {comment}", etc
board.playMove("Qxf7#");

ascii_diagram = board.ascii();

module.exports = (ascii_diagram + "\nIs Checkmate? = " + board.isCheckmate);
