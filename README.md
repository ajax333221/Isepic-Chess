Isepic Chess
================

This is a project written in JavaScript with some of the basic features you would expect to see like legal moves, move list, FEN reader, etc (see [Features](https://github.com/ajax333221/Isepic-Chess#features)). It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.

**Status:** the project is unfinished (see [To Do list](https://github.com/ajax333221/Isepic-Chess#to-do)).

I am trying to make the code as optimized as possible (which is probably a bad idea), I have spent hundreds hours on the structure and fully reviewed the code multiple times, I think my **'testCollision()'** function is pretty cool, this function serves multiple purposes and is where the _all_ the magic happens.
