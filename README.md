Isepic Chess
================

This project is written in JavaScript with some of the basic features you would expect to see like legal moves, move list, FEN reader, etc (see [Features](https://github.com/ajax333221/Isepic-Chess#features)). It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.

**Note:** it is still under construction with multiple [unfinished features](https://github.com/ajax333221/Isepic-Chess#to-do).
