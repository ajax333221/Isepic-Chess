Isepic Chess
================

This is a drag-and-drop chess board written in JavaScript, it uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.

Currently, it can be used to analyze lengthy variations that are hard to calculate mentally or as a FEN reader, but in a near future its purposes will expand to cover more areas (e.g PGN reader).

**Status:** the project is ongoing (see the [To Do list](https://github.com/ajax333221/Isepic-Chess#to-do)).
